======
**Research Interests**: Social Media Mining, Sentiment Analysis, Text Mining, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Interpretable Depression Detection Method on Social Media Networks**, Sep 2020 – Jun 2024

_The Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Lab, Guangdong University of Technology_
* Developed an interpretable depression detection method on social media and explored the heterogeneity of social data and the interactivity of social users
* Found that prompt learning can map users' implicit interpretable psychological symbols, and heterogeneous attention network and subgraph contrastive learning can investigate feature-level and user-level interactions
* Secured two invention patents (CN-2023101434276) and three software copyrights (CCPC-2022SR0708926) based on the outcomes

**Enhanced Semantic and Syntactic Graphs**, Jun – Jul 2023

_Red Bird Challenge Camp, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)_
 	
* Implemented enhanced semantic and syntactic graphs and evaluated their weights via unsupervised learning for fine-grained sentiment analysis in terms of the motion aspect
* Addressed inefficiency and low interpretability in sentiment analysis for space-constrained devices
* Focused on motion-assisted robots
* Presented the findings in multiple presentations, posters, and videos to several research groups
* Relevant publication work is under process.
