<p>**Interpretable Depression Detection Method on Social Media Networks**  Sep 2020 – Jun 2024</p>
_The Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Lab, Guangdong University of Technology_
* Developed an interpretable depression detection method on social media and explored the heterogeneity of social data and the interactivity of social users
* Found that prompt learning can map users' implicit interpretable psychological symbols, and heterogeneous attention network and subgraph contrastive learning can investigate feature-level and user-level interactions
* Secured two invention patents (CN-2023101434276) and three software copyrights (CCPC-2022SR0708926) based on the outcomes
