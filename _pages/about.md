My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Networks, Sentiment Analysis, and Social Media.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Fenghuan Li of the Graph Neural Networks Lab from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.gdut.edu.cn/English/About_us.htm), Guangdong University of Technology. I was advised by Si Li and [Prof. liu dongning](https://www.scholat.com/liudn.en) from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.gdut.edu.cn/English/About_us.htm), Guangdong University of Technology.
