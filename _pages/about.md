I will join the Jayhawk Data Science Lab at the University of Kansas for my Ph.D. in Fall 25, under the supervision of [Dr. Zijun Yao](https://ittc.ku.edu/~zyao/). My current research centers around health informatics, natural language processing, and graph neural networks. Previously, I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from the Guangdong University of Technology in 2024, under the guidance of [Dr. Fenghuan Li](https://dblp.org/pid/07/10130.html), focusing on interpretable depression detection utilizing Graph Neural Networks and contrastive learning. 

You can find my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Tjkj__hEPyMDef0W3BPiehrk6DqvqxN/view?usp=sharing) here.
