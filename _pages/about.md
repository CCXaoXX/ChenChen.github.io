As a graduate of Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the [Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT)](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/), I am profoundly passionate about the interdisciplinary use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in social media mining and sentiment analysis. At GDUT, I had an immersive research experience at the GNN Labs, where I explored topics like interpretable depression detection, resulting in first-author publication. My next objective is to pursue doctoral studies and study information interactivity and dissemination to enhance the interpretability of NLP models. I believe the interpretability of these models is vital to future research.

Pursuing a Ph.D. is primarily driven by my pertinent research and passion for exploring advanced and innovative ideas in NLP and GNNs. I firmly believe that language signifies the essence of social interactions, bridging the gap between machines, individuals, and the broader world. In the future, I aspire to gain an in-depth understanding of the semantics and determine the efficacy of hypergraphs in addressing the issue of transmission chains and social groups. The precise word connotations across diverse contexts and their interpretability can offer valuable insights for language models to tackle complex tasks effectively. I hope to explore these ideas during my doctoral studies.

My research interests include Social Media Mining, Sentiment Analysis, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing and Graph Neural Networks.
