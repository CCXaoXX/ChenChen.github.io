I will join the Jayhawk Data Science Lab at the University of Kansas for my Ph.D. in Fall 25, under the supervision of [Prof. Zijun Yao](https://ittc.ku.edu/~zyao/). My current research centers around health informatics, natural language processing, and graph neural networks. Previously, I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from the Guangdong University of Technology in 2024, under the guidance of Prof. Fenghuan Li, focusing on interpretable depression detection utilizing Graph Neural Networks and contrastive learning.

### [**Chen Chen**, Fenghuan Li, Haopeng Chen, Yuankun Lin, "Heterogeneous Subgraph Network with Prompt Learning for Interpretable Depression Detection on Social Media". Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), 2024.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2025.113215)
Massive social media data can reflect people's authentic thoughts, emotions, communication, etc., therefore can be analyzed for early detection of mental health problems such as depression. Existing works about early depression detection on social media lacked the interpretability and neglected the heterogeneity of social media data. Furthermore, they overlooked the global interaction among users. To address these issues, we develop a novel method that leverages a Heterogeneous Subgraph Network with Prompt Learning(HSNPL) and contrastive learning mechanisms. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to map users' implicit psychological symbols with excellent interpretability while deep semantic and diverse behavioral features are incorporated by a heterogeneous information network. Then, a heterogeneous graph network with a dual attention mechanism is constructed to model the relationships among heterogeneous social information at the feature level. Furthermore, a heterogeneous subgraph network integrating subgraph attention and self-supervised contrastive learning is developed to explore complicated interactions among users and groups at the user level. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for depression detection on social media.
